Yo.

This is a few scripts to find "chirping" channels (vole-like).

Find the chirping channels like this:

0) Modify the first line in find_chirping_channels.py to point towards the directory in which you have rsynced the noise files
1) >> python find_chirping_channels.py runno subrun1 subrun2
2) This creates a .txt file with a list of chirping channels.


If you want to draw the chirping channels and you have all the prequisites for VireViewer installed, do the following:

0) cd VireViewer     (Yes I copied the whole folder here)
1) python draw_chirping_channels.py runno subrun1 subrun2


Enjoy!
